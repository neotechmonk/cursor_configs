# TradeX Strategy Platform - Project Plan

## Project Overview

TradeX Strategy Platform is a flexible trading strategy execution platform with clear separation between decision logic and execution infrastructure, based on the LOM lesson "Inside the Pressure Cooker".

## Architecture Alignment

This project plan follows the core architecture principles defined in README.md:

- **Strategies** = Trade Decision Logic (Provider-agnostic)
- **Providers** = Trade Execution Infrastructure  
- **Portfolios** = Capital Management (Centralized risk)
- **Sessions** = Strategy Orchestration (Provider mapping)

## Current Status

#### 6. System Integration âœ…
- [x] **End-to-End Execution**: Main workflow runs successfully
- [x] **Portfolio Initialization**: Proper capital management with $100,000 initial capital
- [x] **Price Feed Integration**: Successfully loads 4308 bars of price data for CL symbol
- [x] **Session Orchestration**: Sessions properly coordinate between strategies and providers
- [x] **P&L Tracking**: Portfolio-level P&L aggregation working correctly
- [x] **Configuration Validation**: All YAML configurations properly validated and loaded

#### 7. Architecture Improvements âœ…
- [x] **Clean Service Architecture**: Established Protocol -> Service -> Container pattern
- [x] **DI Framework Decoupling**: App logic no longer coupled to dependency injection
- [x] **Testability**: Services can be tested independently without DI setup
- [x] **Interface Definition**: Clear protocol definitions for all service layers
- [x] **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from infrastructure concerns

## ðŸš§ Ready for Higher-Level Refactoring

### Current System Status
The trading system now runs successfully end-to-end with proper protocol compliance and clean architecture:
- Portfolio manages capital and risk limits correctly with clean service architecture
- Sessions orchestrate strategy execution within portfolio constraints
- Price feeds provide data with proper parameter handling
- Configuration system validates and loads all components
- **NEW**: Portfolio class has comprehensive test coverage with clear baseline for pending methods
- **NEW**: Protocol compliance is automatically verified through dynamic testing

**Next Priority**: Apply clean service architecture pattern to other components and focus on strategy execution integration.

## ðŸ“‹ Planned Work

### Phase 0: Architecture Cleanup (Priority: HIGH) âœ… COMPLETED

#### 0.1 Portfolio Service Architecture âœ…
- [x] **Goal**: Establish clean service architecture pattern
- [x] **Tasks**:
  - [x] Create PortfolioServiceProtocol interface
  - [x] Implement PortfolioService business logic
  - [x] Refactor PortfolioContainer to DI configuration only
  - [x] Add comprehensive tests
  - [x] Remove DI coupling from app logic
- [x] **Files modified**:
  - [x] `src/core/portfolio/protocol.py` - Added PortfolioServiceProtocol
  - [x] `src/core/portfolio/container.py` - Refactored to clean architecture
  - [x] `tests/core/portfolio/test_portfolio_container.py` - Added comprehensive tests

#### 0.2 Portfolio Class Testing âœ… NEW
- [x] **Goal**: Establish comprehensive test baseline for Portfolio class
- [x] **Tasks**:
  - [x] Create test suite for Portfolio class with xfail markers for pending methods
  - [x] Add dynamic protocol compliance testing using introspection
  - [x] Test basic creation and property access
  - [x] Test initial capital type conversion
  - [x] Mark all unimplemented methods with xfail
  - [x] Update module __init__.py for clean exports
- [x] **Files modified**:
  - [x] `tests/core/portfolio/test_portfolio.py` - Comprehensive Portfolio class tests
  - [x] `src/core/portfolio/__init__.py` - Clean module exports

#### 0.3 Apply Service Pattern to Other Components (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal**: Apply the same clean service architecture to other components

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Refactor DataProviderContainer to DataProviderService + DataProviderContainer
- [ ] Refactor StrategyContainer to StrategyService + StrategyContainer  
- [ ] Refactor ExecutionProviderContainer to ExecutionProviderService + ExecutionProviderContainer
- [ ] Update all protocols to use "Service" naming convention
- [ ] Ensure all components follow Protocol -> Service -> Container pattern

**Files to modify**:
- `src/core/feed/container.py` - Refactor to service pattern
- `src/core/container/strategies.py` - Refactor to service pattern
- `tests/core/loaders/test_trading_session_loader.py` - Update protocol names

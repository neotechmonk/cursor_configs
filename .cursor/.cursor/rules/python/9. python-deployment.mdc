# Environment Management
- **Virtual Environments:** Deploy applications in virtual environments unless containerised.
- **Dependency Management:** Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `poetry install`.

# Process Management
- **Process Managers:** Use process managers like `systemd`, `Supervisor`, or `Docker` to manage application processes.

# Web Serving
- **Web Servers:** Use web servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve web applications.
- **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.

# Containerization & Infrastructure
- **Containerization:** Use containerization technologies like Docker to package and deploy applications.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

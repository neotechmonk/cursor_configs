"""Integration test template with user story tracking.

This template follows the Integration Scope Focus documentation pattern
and includes user story tracking as per python_testing.mdc guidelines.

1. Copy this template to your test file
2. Replace placeholders with actual implementation
3. Add relevant user stories and acceptance criteria

Documentation Examples:

GOOD - Integration Focus with User Stories:
    Tests TradingSession → RiskAdapter → OrderManager integration with risk rejection.
    
    Validates that risk validation properly blocks orders that exceed limits.
    
    User Stories:
    US001: As a trader, I want risk controls to prevent catastrophic losses
           AC5: System must reject orders exceeding per-trade risk limits
    US006: As a risk manager, I want session-level risk monitoring
           AC12: System must track and limit total session exposure
    
    
    Why GOOD:
    - Clear integration scope (TradingSession → RiskAdapter → OrderManager)
    - Specific validation purpose (blocks orders exceeding limits)
    - Relevant user stories with acceptance criteria
    - Succinct without repeating test name information

BAD 1 - Vague and Redundant:
    Test order submission with excessive risk fails validation.
    
    This test checks that when we submit an order with too much risk,
    the validation fails and returns an error message.
    
    
    Why BAD
    - Repeats what the test name already says
    - No integration context (what modules are involved?)
    - No user story references
    - No business context or impact

BAD 2 - Too Verbose and Implementation-Focused:
    Tests the submit_order method of TradingSession class when called with order data
    that has a quantity of 20 shares at $100 per share, which equals $2000 total value,
    against a risk limit of $1000 per trade, ensuring that the risk validation logic
    in the SessionRiskManagementAdapter properly calculates the total risk and compares
    it against the configured maximum risk per trade setting, and when the calculated
    risk exceeds the limit, the method should return a failure result with appropriate
    error messaging, and the order manager should not be called.
    
    User Stories:
    US001: As a trader, I want risk controls to prevent catastrophic losses
           AC5: System must reject orders exceeding per-trade risk limits

    
    Why BAD2:
    - Overly detailed implementation specifics
    - Reads like a step-by-step manual
    - Hard to scan and understand quickly
    - Mixes business context with technical details

#     def test_open_closed_principle_through_interface_usage()
#     def test_dependency_inversion_principle_at_integration_boundaries()
#     
#     Why GOOD:
#     - Tests data flow between modules (A → B → C)
#     - Validates error propagation across boundaries
#     - Ensures contract compliance between modules
#     - Enforces architectural patterns at integration points
#     - Validates design principles through behavior
#     - Tests integration points, not internal logic
#     - Focuses on module boundaries and interfaces

# BAD1 - Testing Internal Module Logic (Unit Test Territory):
#     def test_session_validates_input_data()
#     def test_session_handles_invalid_config()
#     def test_risk_adapter_gets_required_keys()
#     def test_risk_adapter_validates_risk_data()
#     
#     Why BAD1:
#     - These are unit tests, not integration tests
#     - Testing internal logic of individual modules
#     - Should be in tests/module/unit/ not integration
#     - Doesn't test module boundaries or data flow

# BAD2 - Testing Implementation Details:
#     def test_session_calls_risk_adapter_method_once()
#     def test_risk_adapter_sets_internal_state_correctly()
#     def test_order_manager_logs_debug_message()
#     def test_risk_manager_updates_counter_variable()
#     
#     Why BAD2:
#     - Tests implementation details, not integration
#     - Brittle - breaks when internal implementation changes
#     - Doesn't test module boundaries or contracts
#     - Focuses on "how" not "what" modules do together

# BAD3 - Missing Integration Scenarios:
#     def test_session_risk_adapter_integration()
#     # Missing: error propagation tests
#     # Missing: data flow validation
#     # Missing: contract compliance tests
#     # Missing: end-to-end workflow tests
#     
#     Why BAD3:
#     - Too generic, doesn't test specific integration points
#     - Missing critical boundary testing
#     - No validation of data flow between modules
#     - Incomplete integration coverage

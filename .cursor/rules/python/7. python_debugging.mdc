# Common Mistakes
- Avoid mutable defaults
- Use `==` for value vs `is` for identity
- Don’t swallow exceptions silently
- Keep `try` blocks small
- Use virtual environments

# Edge Cases
- Floating-point limits → use `decimal`/int where needed
- Unicode handling
- File encoding explicit
- Timezone-aware datetimes

# Version Issues
- Avoid deprecated features
- Ensure library compatibility with current Python

# Debugging Tools
- Use `pdb` for step debugging
- Logging over print
- Assertions for expected states
- Profilers for perf issues
- Remote debugging tools as needed

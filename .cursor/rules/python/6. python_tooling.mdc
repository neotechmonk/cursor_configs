description: Tooling rules for packaging, linting, typing, deployment, and CI/CD.
appliesTo:
  - python

# Tooling
- Use uv instead of pip and venv. 
  - Build config: `pyproject.toml`
  - use `uv add [package]` or `uv remove [package]` as opposed editing `pyproject.toml` directly or `requirements.txt`
  - always create a virtual environment under  `[root]\.venv` 
- Lint/format: `ruff`
- Typing: `mypy`
- Notebook envs: Jupyter

# Deployment
- Deploy in virtual envs
- Use Docker/containerization in which case venv is not needed
- IaC for infra (TPulumi, etc.)
- Process managers: `systemd`

# CI/CD
- Run lint + tests on every commit
- Automated deployments
- Pin dependencies for reproducibility
- Include coverage reports

# Validation Principles
- Validate early and don't replicate noisy validation down the chain (keeps code DRY and validation at the boundaries)

# Input Validation Strategies
- Validate input against a whitelist of allowed values
- Use regular expressions to validate input formats
- Ensure input data types are correct
- Limit the length of input strings

# Security & Sanitization
- Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from input

# Validation Libraries
- Use libraries like `pydantic`, `pydantic-settings`, `cerberus` and `schematics` to assist with validating the input
